Look around the site’s files and see if you can figure out how to modify the About page and the blog’s title from about.qmd and _quarto.yml.\nSee these pages for help: about page, config options.\nIf you are comfortable with css, then you can directly modify style.css and other files in the repo.\nAll this is optional, and it’s not necessary to put your real name or real photo anywhere on the site."

You have to submit both of them for your homework to be graded.\n\nFor the PDF assingment, please submit your newly-created blog page printed as PDF. You do not need to publish your blog to the web for the homework. It is enough to print the preview page as a PDF and submit on Gradescope. If you want to publish it online, you are welcome to do so.\nFor the programming assignment, please submit any code file you wrote for your homework. All the .py file, .ipynb file, or .qmd files all included. The grader should be able to reproduce your result from the code portion you submitted.\n\n\nHint\nThe easiest way to create a post like this is to solve the problem in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script first, and then transfer the results over to your blog."

If you place the word “{python}” immediately after the opening code blocks, you’ll get attractive syntax highlighting:\n\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. \n    \"\"\"\n    return 2*x\n\ny = f(3)\nprint(y)\n\n6\n\n\nNot only that, once you render the page with Quarto, the code output will show up below. If that’s not what you want, use the word “python” instead of “{python}”\nLook at this other cool example from the Quarto tutorial.\nFor a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see Figure 1.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A line plot on a polar axis"
