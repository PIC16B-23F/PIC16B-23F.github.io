In this post, we’ll get set up with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Quarto is a static site converter, which you can use to turn plaintext documents into attractive webpages. You should have already installed Quarto and signed up for Quarto Pub when completing the software installation (details in BruinLearn).

## Make a blog

This should be very straightforward using the instructions at [this link](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#quick-start).

All you need to do is run the following code at the terminal.

```bash
quarto create-project myblog --type website:blog
```

Then once a folder appears, run this line.

```bash
quarto preview myblog
```

Feel free to replace `myblog` with a different name.

`quarto preview` should open up a link that looks like `http://localhost:6832` in your web browser. The port number probably looks different.

## Publish on Quarto Pub

Now, run this line on your terminal in the same directory.

```bash
quarto publish myblog
```

When prompted, select these options.

    ? Provider: › Quarto Pub
    ? Authorize (Y/n) › Yes

Finally, the terminal should print out something like this:

    [✓] Creating quarto-pub site
    [✓] Preparing to publish site
    [✓] Uploading files (complete)
    [✓] Deploying published site
    [✓] Published site: https://quartopub.com/sites/[...]
    [✓] Account site updated: https://[Quarto Pub username].quarto.pub

Go to the website on the last line, and if you see a webpage there, congrats! Your blog is up and running. At the moment, it’s just a copy of the template, so it’s not personalized in any way.

## Edit a post
Preview your blog again:

```bash
quarto preview myblog
```

Then edit the welcome page in `posts/welcome/index.qmd`. Any sort of change will do.

Once you save the file, you’ll see that the preview page on the web browser is automatically updated.

You can also add a new page following instructions in [this post](../composing).

## Publish again
Once you’ve made all these additions, publish the result again using `quarto publish`. In a few minutes, you should see your new post on your website.
