When talking about a short concept, like the np.random.rand() function, you can type back ticks like this: `np.random.rand()`.\nTo create a larger block of code, use three consecutive backticks ``` to both open and close the code block. If you place the word “{python}” immediately after the opening code blocks, you’ll get attractive syntax highlighting:\n\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. \n    \"\"\"\n    return 2*x\n\ny = f(3)\nprint(y)\n\n6\n\n\nNot only that, once you render the page with Quarto, the code output will show up below. If that’s not what you want, use the word “python” instead of “{python}”\nLook at this other cool example from the Quarto tutorial.\nFor a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see Figure 1.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A line plot on a polar axis"
